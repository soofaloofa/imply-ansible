# The data sources that you have configured, these will appear, in order, inside the navigation menu of Pivot
# In general there can be two types of 'engine':
#   - native: a JSON file that is crunched within plywood itself (useful for small datasets and testing)
#   - druid: a Druid dataSource
dataSources:

    engine: druid # Set the engine to druid
    source: wikiticker # The druid dataSource

    timeAttribute: time # The time attribute (this needs to be set for Druid, but could be anything. You should leave it as 'time')

    # The refresh rule describes how often the data source looks for new data, it has to be fixed here since this data source is static
    refreshRule:
      rule: fixed # also possible: 'query' and 'realtime'
